    <p> Illustrated Environment is basically taking a photo that you took or from the internet and tracing the shapes to have a foreground, middle ground and background. When I was making my first illustrated environment, I was thinking it was so cool because of the shape and colors. It reminds me of all those illustrated environment art that is sold at street shops. I always want to make one but never knew how to until now so I’m glad I get to make one today. The challenges I faced while making one was that I wanted to trace it exactly as the photo but it was hard to get every detail. Another challenge was finding a photo because I thought lot of photos look very nice to make it into a illustrated environment but I needed one that is not only just a background. </p>

    <p> I learned that you have to lock the first photo that you want to trace in so that it won’t affect the photo while you are tracing. You can trace the photo by using the pen and zoom in so you can get the details. You can get colors that complement each other by using the official website of Adobe color or using the color wheel. When you like the colors that you made then you can save the color from the website or copy the hex color and paste it into your color wheel in Illustrator. I hope to grain from this course was how to increase my art and appreciate more of art and people who make art. </p>
